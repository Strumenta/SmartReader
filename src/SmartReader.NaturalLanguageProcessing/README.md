### Smart Reader - Natural Language Processing

This library provides a basic implementation for the natural language processing of SmartReader. At the moment we only implement a way to identify the langauge based on the text of the article. We use a FastText-based library to do that.

We want to provide also a basic implementation for creating a summary, but there is no timeline yet.

 This library is meant to be just a wrapper to hook natural language processing features into SmartReader. Implementation of the features come from other libraries.
